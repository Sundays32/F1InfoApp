      <h3>Background Information</h3>
      <h5>
        The Aston Martin team's origins date back to the Jordan Grand Prix
        outfit that first entered F1 back in 1991. The squad won four races in
        total over the years, and finished third in the 1999 Constructors'
        Championship. Financial problems eventually saw them fall off the pace,
        before team owner Eddie Jordan sold up to the Midland Group in early
        2005.
      </h5>
      <p>
        Renamed Midland F1 Racing, the team spent two seasons struggling at the
        back of the field before owner Alex Shnaider sold to Spyker Cars midway
        through the 2006 campaign. Spyker F1 scored a point in 2007 and briefly
        led the European Grand Prix with Markus Winkelhock. However, money woes
        resulted in the outfit being purchased by Indian businessman Vijay
        Mallya for â‚¬88 million. The team was renamed as Force India Formula 1
        Team.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team started the season strongly, capped off by Perez's third-place
        finish in Bahrain, marking their first podium result since the 2009
        Belgian Grand Prix. The Mexican scored the team's third fastest lap in
        Australia, and the outfit finished the year sixth in the standings with
        155 points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the team only debuted the VJM08 on Day 2 of the third and final
        2015 pre-season test at Barcelona, Force India had a somewhat strong
        start to the campaign. Hulkenberg finished seventh in Australia, yet the
        team went on to finish outside of the points on several occasions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hulkenberg left in 2017, with Esteban Ocon brought in as his replacement
        after having driven for Manor in the second half of the previous season.
        A new sponsorship deal with BWT resulted in a livery change, with the
        team now sporting a pink design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perez and Ocon returned for the 2018 campaign, which had a slow start as
        the drivers finished in the points just once from the opening three
        races. Perez came home third in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, and that
        kicked off a run of four straight finishes in the points for the
        Mexican. Ocon, though, had to wait until the ninth race of the season in
        Austria for his first points of the year. Force India were put into
        administration during the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend, with the legal
        action kickstarted by creditors, including Perez, in order to allow the
        team to continue operating while searching for a new owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team were eventually purchased by a consortium led by Lawrence
        Stroll. The association were only able to buy the assets of the team,
        resulting in Force India being excluded from the championship and
        replaced by the new Force India Racing Point outfit. The new squad were
        unable to keep any of the points scored by the old team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to the start of the 2019 season, the Force India name was dropped,
        with the team competing as Racing Point F1 Team. Lance Stroll, son of
        Lawrence, and Perez were the team's drivers for the campaign, scoring
        points at the first four races to go along with a double points finish
        in Azerbaijan. However, they struggled during the middle of the year,
        with Stroll finishing ninth in Canada and ending a run of six races
        without points.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 61 years, Aston Martin finally returned to F1 as a constructor in
        2021. Led by new owner and CEO Lawrence Stroll and Team Principal Otmar
        Szafnauer, the green machine was back racing in the top category of
        motorsport.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following Vettel's decision to walk away from Formula 1, it was
        announced that Fernando Alonso would replace him at Aston Martin in
        2023. The team showed great improvment in performance in the 2023
        season, scoring multiple podiums but without any wins. The team finished
        the season at 5th position
